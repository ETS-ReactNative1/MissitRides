# MissitRides

MissIt Rides is a ride-share application built to demonstrate one potential instance of the utility of the
low rate MissIt data communication channel. In this project we detailed the implementation of the MissIt
Rides application, which is constrained by MissIt and our API interactions. With these constraints in
mind, we have attempted to optimize user experience by introducing new features not typically found
in ride-sharing apps. Our results show that this application has potential in specific use cases. In order
to be more widely applicable, it is necessary to further develop its key components.

The application is built in Python for a mock backend simulating the MissIt network, and in React Native in the frontend.
